# Predator Alert Tool for Match.com

This project is under construction. It does not yet work. Contributions are deeply appreciated!

## Eventual README Under Construction

The Predator Alert Tool for Match.com, or PAT-Match.com, is a tool that alerts you of profiles on [IAC's Match.com dating site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match.com) belonging to people who have reportedly violated others' consent, such as through sexual assault or rape. This tool is based on the popular Predator Alert Tool for FetLife, and the almost identical Predator Alert Tool for ChristianMingle.

The Predator Alert Tool for Match.com (PAT-Match.com) empowers Internet users like you to anonymously report harassment, rape, and other abuses they have experienced at the hands of a person with a Match.com account. Your report is then automatically disemminated to other PAT-Match.com, as well as being published on the open Internet.

Additionally:

* While browsing Match.com, the Predator Alert Tool will visually highlight any user profile you encounter that has allegedly violated another person's consent. Click through to the user's profile for a complete listing of reported consent violations.
* Each time you load a user's Match.com profile, that user's profile picture is scanned against the United States's Sex Offender Registry using the facial recognition service provided by CreepShield.com, and the most likely match is shown to you:

#### Using (NOTE: not yet available for use)

To use the Predator Alert Tool for Match.com (PAT-Match.com), [log in to your Match.com account](http://www.match.com/login/index/#/) and click the "(report a consent violation by *username*)" link next to the Match.com username of the user who you wish to report for an alleged assault, rape, or other violation of your consent.

When you click a "report a consent violation" link, you will be presented with a form asking you for pertinent information related to the violation you would like to report. Follow the instructions on the form and click "Submit" to complete your report.

Once you have filed your report, it will be displayed to other PAT-Match.com users near the top of the alleged abuser's Match.com profile, as shown in the example below:

The image below will eventually be a screenshot of a Match.com profile picture with a record of an alleged consent violation.

Please be patient. It may take up to 24 hours for your report to be visible on Match.com pages to other PAT-Match.com users, but it will be immediately available on the open Internet in a public database [similar to this one for PAT-ChristianMingle](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0ArYmNHuRadHbdEFzQmZzUHl1dUV0VGgzZ1h6NE5NY0E&output=html).

Avoid using abbreviations when you complete the "Where did the abuse happen?" question in the report form when you are filing a report yourself. That is, prefer entering "Baltimore, Maryland" over "B'more, MD."

The entire database of alleged abuses will EVENTUALLY be available for download to anyone, regardless of whether they use PAT-Match.com or not, in multiple formats. The below links are the similar download links for PAT-ChristianMingle.

### Frequently Asked Questions

Before you report a new issue with the Predator Alert Tool for Match.com (PAT-Match.com), please check to ensure your question is not already addressed in the list below.

* [Can I report a consent violation anonymously?](#can-i-report-a-consent-violation-anonymously)
* [Can I report a consent violation if I don't have a Match.com account?](#can-i-report-a-consent-violation-if-i-dont-have-a-Match.com-account)

* [Where can I learn more about this issue?](#where-can-i-learn-more-about-this-issue)

#### Can I report a consent violation anonymously?

Yes. PAT-Match.com will never require the use of your personally identifying information to be reported, nor will it ever collect your personal information. When you file a report of abuse, you are welcome to include as much or as little information about yourself as you feel comfortable doing.

#### Can I report a consent violation if I don't have a Match.com account?

Yes. Anyone can file a report, regardless of whether they, themselves, have a Match.com account. However, allegations can only be made *against* users of Match.com.

If you don't have a Match.com account, you can still access and submit the report form (COMING SOON). However, some fields, such as the person's numeric Match.com user ID and profile name, will not be be automatically filled in. Follow the instructions on the report form to help you complete any fields not already pre-filled.

If you know that a particular person has both a Match.com and a Facebook profile, you can also use the [Predator Alert Tool for Facebook](https://apps.facebook.com/predator-alert-tool/) to link the two profiles together and alert your friends on both sites.

#### Can I remove myself from the database?

No. There will never be an option for removing anyone from the database. And no, I'm not sorry about that.

#### What can I do if I've been falsely accused?

You can update your Match.com profile to address the allegation. Be sure to respond to the allegation at the very beginning of your "About me" section so that it is displayed close to the report you believe is false. Each report filed against you is numbered, so if you believe there are multiple false accusations, you can refer (and even link) to them by number. For instance, if your Match.com user nickname is `ExampleUser`, and you have two PAT-Match.com reports associated with your profile, then you can link to the second of the two reports on your profile page with the following (CURRENTLY INVALID) URL: [https://ChristianMingle.com/search/details.html?u=ExampleUser#faade_abuse_report-2](https://ChristianMingle.com/search/details.html?u=ExampleUser#faade_abuse_report-2)
